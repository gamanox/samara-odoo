# Environment-specific configuration files (if any)
# You might want to exclude local configuration files that contain sensitive information
# or are specific to a developer's environment.
# For example, if you have a local_config.py file:
# local_config.py

# Data files generated by Odoo (e.g., attachments, backups)
# If your custom addon generates or stores data files within its directory,
# consider excluding them if they are not part of the source code.
# For example, if your addon creates a 'data' directory for generated files:
# data/
